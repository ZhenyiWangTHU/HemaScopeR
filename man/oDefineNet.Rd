\arguments{
\item{network}{the built-in network. Currently two sources of network information are supported: the STRING database (version 10) and the Pathway Commons database (version 7). STRING is a meta-integration of undirect interactions from the functional aspect, while Pathways Commons mainly contains both undirect and direct interactions from the physical/pathway aspect. Both have scores to control the confidence of interactions. Therefore, the user can choose the different quality of the interactions. In STRING, "STRING_highest" indicates interactions with highest confidence (confidence scores>=900), "STRING_high" for interactions with high confidence (confidence scores>=700), "STRING_medium" for interactions with medium confidence (confidence scores>=400), and "STRING_low" for interactions with low confidence (confidence scores>=150). For undirect/physical interactions from Pathways Commons, "PCommonsUN_high" indicates undirect interactions with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), "PCommonsUN_medium" for undirect interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). For direct (pathway-merged) interactions from Pathways Commons, "PCommonsDN_high" indicates direct interactions with high confidence (supported with the PubMed references plus at least 2 different sources), and "PCommonsUN_medium" for direct interactions with medium confidence (supported with the PubMed references). In addition to pooled version of pathways from all data sources, the user can also choose the pathway-merged network from individual sources, that is, "PCommonsDN_Reactome" for those from Reactome, "PCommonsDN_KEGG" for those from KEGG, "PCommonsDN_HumanCyc" for those from HumanCyc, "PCommonsDN_PID" for those froom PID, "PCommonsDN_PANTHER" for those from PANTHER, "PCommonsDN_ReconX" for those from ReconX, "PCommonsDN_TRANSFAC" for those from TRANSFAC, "PCommonsDN_PhosphoSite" for those from PhosphoSite, and "PCommonsDN_CTD" for those from CTD. For direct (pathway-merged) interactions sourced from KEGG, it can be 'KEGG' for all, 'KEGGc_Metabolism' for pathways grouped into 'Metabolism', 'KEGGc_GeneticProcess' for 'Genetic Process' pathways, 'KEGGc_EnvironmentalProcess' for 'Environmental Process' pathways, 'KEGGc_CellularProcess' for 'Cellular Process' pathways, 'KEGGc_OrganismalSystem' for 'Organismal System' pathways, and 'KEGGc_HumanDisease' for 'Human Disease' pathways. For KEGG 'Environmental Process' pathways, it can be further into 'KEGGs_ImmuneSystem','KEGGs_EndocrineSystem','KEGGs_CirculatorySystem','KEGGs_DigestiveSystem','KEGGs_ExcretorySystem','KEGGs_NervousSystem','KEGGs_SensorySystem','KEGGs_DevelopmentAndRegeneration','KEGGs_Aging','KEGGs_EnvironmentalAdaptation'. 'REACTOME' for protein-protein interactions derived from Reactome pathways. 'HuRI' for human reference direct interactome (biophysical), while 'HuRI_union' for all HuRI identified so far, 'HuRI_litbm' for literature-derived direct interactions, and 'HuRI_all' for the union of 'HuRI_union' and 'HuRI_litbm'}

\item{STRING.only}{the further restriction of STRING by interaction type. If NA, no such restriction. Otherwide, it can be one or more of "neighborhood_score","fusion_score","cooccurence_score","coexpression_score","experimental_score","database_score","textmining_score". Useful options are c("experimental_score","database_score"): only experimental data (extracted from BIND, DIP, GRID, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, and PID) and curated data (extracted from Biocarta, BioCyc, GO, KEGG, and Reactome) are used}

\item{weighted}{logical to indicate whether edge weights should be considered. By default, it sets to false. If true, it only works for the network from the STRING database}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display}

\item{placeholder}{the characters to tell the placeholder of RDS files. See \code{\link{oRDS}} for details}

\item{guid}{a valid (5-character) Global Unique IDentifier for an OSF project. See \code{\link{oRDS}} for details}

\description{
\code{oDefineNet} is supposed to define a gene network sourced from the STRING database or the Pathway Commons database. It returns an object of class "igraph".
